# **Reviewing and Validating AI-Generated Code**

AI coding assistants are powerful tools, but they are not infallible. They can generate code that is inefficient, incorrect, or insecure. **All AI-generated code must be treated as if it were written by a new junior developer and subjected to a rigorous review process.**

### **1\. The Human-in-the-Loop is Mandatory**

Never trust AI-generated code blindly. A qualified developer must always review, understand, and take ownership of any code before it is committed to the codebase. The developer, not the AI, is ultimately responsible for the code's quality and behavior.

### **2\. Verify Logic and Correctness**

* **Does it solve the problem?** Carefully trace the logic to ensure it correctly implements the required functionality and handles all edge cases.  
* **Is it efficient?** AI models may not always choose the most performant algorithm or data structure. Look for performance bottlenecks, such as nested loops that could be replaced with more efficient lookups.

### **3\. Scrutinize for Security Vulnerabilities**

AI models are trained on vast amounts of public code, including code with known vulnerabilities. Be extra vigilant for common security flaws:

* **Injection Attacks**: Ensure that user input is always sanitized and that parameterized queries or ORMs are used for database access (e.g., no string concatenation to build SQL queries).  
* **Incorrect Error Handling**: Check that exceptions are caught and handled properly, without leaking sensitive information in error messages.  
* **Insecure Defaults**: Verify that security settings (e.g., cryptography, permissions) are configured according to best practices, not insecure defaults.

### **4\. Ensure Code Style and Consistency**

AI-generated code may not match your team's established coding standards and conventions.

* **Formatting**: Reformat the code to match your style guide.  
* **Naming Conventions**: Ensure variables, methods, and classes are named according to your team's conventions.  
* **Architectural Patterns**: Verify that the code fits within the existing architecture and doesn't introduce anti-patterns.

### **5\. Write and Run Comprehensive Tests**

The best way to validate any code, whether written by a human or an AI, is with a robust suite of tests.

* **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to cover the specific logic of the AI-generated function or class.  
* **Integration Tests**: If the code interacts with other systems (databases, APIs), write integration tests to ensure those interactions work as expected.  
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Consider writing the tests *before* prompting the AI. This gives you a clear definition of "done" and an immediate way to validate the generated code.
