# **Enterprise Best Practices for AI Coding Assistants**

This repository contains guidelines, best practices, and code examples for leveraging AI-powered coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, etc.) effectively and safely within an enterprise environment.  
The goal is to provide a framework for development teams to maximize the benefits of AI tools while mitigating potential risks related to security, code quality, and intellectual property.
